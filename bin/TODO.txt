-Implement FarmerType and its benefits

-Plant seed
    -the fruit tree crop has a special planting condition. 
    Aside from needing enough money to buy the seed and having the tile plowed, 
    there should be no tiles next to the selected tile with any objects. 
    This means fruit trees should be planted away at least one (1) tile away 
    from occupied tiles â€“ check immediate sides and diagonals.
